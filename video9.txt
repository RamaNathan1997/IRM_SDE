             THE RICHARDSON MATURITY


*The Richardson model defines four levels from level 0 to 3.

*Level 0 is often called the Swamp of POX(Plain Old XML).

*Level 0 means that the API is not RESTful.

*Level 1 has individual URI's for each resource.

*Level 2 has the right usage of HTTP methods & Status codes for each of the URI's.

*Level 3 implements HATEOAS ,where the responses have links that the clients can use.It means that the API is fully RESTful.
