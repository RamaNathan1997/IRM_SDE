*Web Services:
           Web Services are services that are exposed to the internet for programmatic access.
*Web Services are of two types :
            1.REST Web Services.
            2.SOAP Web Services.
*Web Service characteristics:
 ->  exchange of data happens over the web over http
                 data
 -> client     <-------      web services
 -> The message format between the client and the server is called Protocol,which is standardized in some web services.
    eg: SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol)
 -> REST Web Service has no protocol.The client can send messages in XML,JSON,text or any other format.
 -> Messages can be exchanged between the client and the server in all HTTP methods.
 -> RESTful Web Services have no service definition.
 -> Unlike SOAP,there are no specifications for RESTful Web Services.
 -> The term REST was coined by Roy Fielding.
 -> REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
 -> It is a set of architectural styles or guidlines for an application.
        REST   +     Web Services   =   RESTful Web 
                                         Services.
